### Project Overview

 This project includes deciphering of a message. A number of multiple text files need to be read and have certain operations performed to get the final message.


### Learnings from the project

 After completing this project I got a better understanding of solving logical problems using python.


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 Concepts of string operations, conditional statements and loops, file I/O and functions were taken into consideration in order to solve the problem.


### Challenges faced

 It became a bit difficult to find out the right solution in less period of time. I overcame this difficulty by looking into the previous code and analyzing what exactly is required and then finally came up with the solution.


### Additional pointers

 Though being a bit difficult, it was indeed an interesting project to solve.
